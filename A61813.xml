            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON ON ROMANS viii. 3.</head>
            <q>—God ſending his own Son, in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſin in the fleſh.</q>
            <p>SInce the Deſign of this Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, is with all Thankfulneſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the Incarnation of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord: What can be more proper to entertain our Devotion, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the great end, for which he was Incarnate? Which however groſly miſtaken, by thoſe who are reſolved, not to underſtand it; is plainly enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100329:3"/> in the words now read; To be the ſetting us free from the Bondage of Sin, and the making us partakers of his Holineſs. A matter of ſuch Grand Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in the Judgment of the <hi>only wiſe God,</hi> that he thought it worth the <hi>ſending his own Son</hi> into the world, after he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it by other means without ſucceſs. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh;</hi> When mens fleſhly Luſts were ſo ſtrong and impetuous, that the Law of it ſelf, was unable to ſubdue them, and to advance Mankind to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inward Purity, of which all the outward Purifications preſcribed by the Law were but ſhadows; as a more powerful efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous means, in order to this great end, God out of his infinite Compaſſion to loſt man, <hi>ſent his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As preparatory to the enſuing Diſcourſe, 'tis needful only to acquaint you; That by the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (tranſlated <hi>for ſin)</hi> is meant a Sacrifice for ſin: That being the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt agreeable to the Scope of the Text; and that in which they are frequently uſed, both by the Septuagint, and our Apoſtle.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100329:3"/> That to <hi>condemn ſin,</hi> is not barely to paſs Sentence againſt it; but to puniſh and to deſtroy it. That God is ſaid to <hi>condemn ſin in the fleſh, by ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, to be a ſacrifice for it;</hi> Becauſe he moſt dreadfully puniſhed it, in the fleſh of his Son; and hath thereby taken the moſt effectual courſe, to deſtroy it in our fleſh: as he is ſaid in Holy Scripture to do thoſe things, for the effecting of which, he contributes ſufficient means: ſo that nothing is wanting on his part, for the doing of them.</p>
            <p>Which being Premiſed, the words are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſolved into theſe five Propoſitions.

And therefore his <hi>only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son</hi> too; ſuch as no other perſon in the World, is, ever was, or ſhall be.</p>
            <p>And in proportion to the peculiar, and tranſcendent Excellency of his Sonſhip, was his Father's Love towards him; for being his <hi>only begotten,</hi> he was above all others his <hi>beloved Son;</hi> as he himſelf teſtified, by an expreſs voice from Heaven, ſaying; <hi>this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matt. iii. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And the greater God's Love was to Him, ſo much the more was it expreſſed to Us, to whom <hi>alone</hi> he ſent him. For he ſent him not to the Apoſtate Angels, to expiate their ſins, and to avert the ſtroak of his vengeance from them; but leaving them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100329:4"/> under an irreverſible Doom, to be reſerv'd to Chains of Darkneſs at the judgment of <note place="margin">Jude <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> the Great Day; He ſent him to us Men, who are by Nature inferiour to the Angels, and were become confederate with them in their Rebellion againſt him; who were not only without Strength, to reſiſt his Juſtice; but too obſtinate to implore his Mercy.</p>
            <p>This is intimated in the Text; For in that God ſent him, <hi>in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> 'tis alſo implyed that he ſent him to <hi>ſinful fleſh:</hi> To the Sons of Men, <hi>who had all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>

               <hi>Son to be a propitiation for our ſins. That in this was manifeſt the Love of God toward Us, that God ſent his only begotten Son, that We might live through him.</hi> His Love was indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt toward Us, his Severity toward the Angels; in that while he left them to fall a Sacrifice to his Juſtice, he ſent his <hi>belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Son,</hi> to be Himſelf a Sacrifice in Our room.</p>

But becauſe the only Son of God, as he is born of God, is infinitely exalted, above the reach of Suffering, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of Dying; That therefore he might be qualified to become a Sacrifice for us; <hi>God ſent him into the World in fleſh;</hi> (which is the ſecond Propoſition) Not in the Likeneſs, (as ſome ancient Hereticks phancied) but in the Truth and Reality of fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Word was made fleſh</hi> (ſays St. <hi>John;)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 1. 14.</note> Tho' begotten of the Father, and not made; that he might become Sin for us, he was made fleſh. He that from the Beginning was in the World in the Form of God, in the Fulneſs of time, was ſent into the World, in the Nature of Man; that as the Son of Man he might ſuffer and die; as the Son of God, might conquer Death, and give that Value to his ſufferings, which might make them a Compleat ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And that he took upon him the Humane Nature, and in the Nature he aſſumed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill the ſame Perſon, came into the World a True Man (which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               <hi>Truth.</hi> Nor doth he only entitle Himſelf, Man, but more frequently the Son of Man, which ſhews him to have been of Humane Extraction, and by neceſſary conſequence of the ſame Nature. If we deſire to know his Pedigree, we need look no further than the Goſpel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who hath deriv'd it as far backward, as from the common Father of Mankind.

               <hi>David</hi> it was, who was ſo highly favoured by God, as to be made his Mother.</p>
            <p>But had he as <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> been repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Holy Scripture, as without Father <note place="margin">Heb. vii. 3.</note> and without Mother too; yet who can call in queſtion the Truth of his Humanity, who conſiders, that he had a Body of the ſame ſubſtance with our Own? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Children were partakers of fleſh and</hi>

            <p>In brief: ſo wonderful was the Father's Love, and the Sons condeſcenſion; that he became not only a Man; but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon account of the World, a man of the meaneſt Birth and Quality, (for the Family <note place="margin">Philip. ii. 7.</note> of <hi>David</hi> was then obſcure) He made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no Reputation, leſſened himſelf into

He was made fleſh in the more humble ſenſe of the word, as it is put for weakneſs and Frailty, for that which is vile and contemptible; being made ſubject to thoſe abaſing, ſinleſs Infirmities, to which the moſt deſpicable of the Sons of men are.

I ſay Natural, on purpoſe to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch as are Perſonal; for though he did not take upon himſelf thoſe Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by which one man differs from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet he became obnoxious to all thoſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100329:7"/> that adhere to the Humane Nature, and ſo are common to the whole Race of Mankind. Whether they be ſuch, as follow the Nature of a frail mortal Body; as Hunger, Thirſt, Wearineſs; Pain, yea, Death it ſelf; or ſuch as attend the Souls of other Men; as Sorrow, Fear, Amazement. So great, ſo many, ſo continual were his ſorrows, that the Prophet calls him, <hi>a man of ſorrows,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. liii. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and acquainted with griefs.</hi> Now although theſe Infirmities are not in themſelves ſins, and therefore the Son of God took upon him a Humane Nature ſubject to them; yet becauſe moſt of thoſe before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are in all other Men the Fruits and Puniſhments of ſin; therefore by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, he took upon himſelf the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Sinner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe God ſent him into the World under the Law. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was</hi>

               <hi>come</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law.</hi> That he was under the Law as to its Curſe, and ſuffered the Penalty due to a Sinner, will afterward appear. That which I now intend is, that he was made ſubject to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100329:7"/> Commands; not of the Moral only, but of the Ceremonial Law, which ſuppoſed ſin in thoſe who were obliged to the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. He was Circumciſed the Eighth day, which was the reputed Badge of a Sinner, as ſuppoſing ſome Impurities of the fleſh that were to be cut off. Tho' he was <hi>the Lamb of God that took away the ſins</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John i. 29.</note> 
               <hi>of the World;</hi> Yet he eat the Paſchal Lamb together with his Diſciples; as if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſtood in need of an Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Thus by ſubmitting to ſuch Rites, as imply'd ſin in the Obſervers of them; he ſeem'd to be of the ſame ſinful mould and Conſtitution with other Men. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. And eſpecially, God ſent him <hi>in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh;</hi> becauſe he ſent him to be Treated as a Sinner. <hi>He made him to be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. v. 21.</note> 
               <hi>ſin for us;</hi> to be reckoned, and dealt with, as one guilty of the blackeſt Enormities. He was accuſed of the Higheſt Impieties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, of the Groſſeſt Injuſtice toward Men, of the fouleſt Intemperance in reſpect of Himſelf. So Monſtrous a ſinner was he deem'd, by thoſe who were the Legal Judges in ſuch Caſes, that a Robber and a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100329:8"/> Murderer when compared with Him, were reputed Innocent. He was accordingly condemned to Death, by the ſentence of the S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pream Magiſtrate; and to ſuch a Death, as none but the very ſcum and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Mankind were ever put to. And yet as if that Opprobrious Death, had been too little to repreſent to the World, how vile a Malefactor they thought him, to aggravate the ſhame and Torment of it they added all manner of Indignities, by which they were able to expreſs, their utmoſt Scorn and Deteſtation of him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Son of God, (as was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propheſied) <hi>was numbred with the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. liii. 12.</note> was treated as an infamous Perſon while he lived; and as ſuch was cut off from the Land of the Living. And all this was done by <hi>the determinate Counſel and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>of God</hi> (as <hi>St. Peter</hi> tells us.) And we cannot eaſily imagine, how God could contrive more Effectually, to ſet forth his Son in the ugly Dreſs of a ſinner, than by expoſing him to all the moſt abhorr'd and Reproachful uſages, that the worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ever expos'd to.</p>

            <p> But tho' in theſe Reſpects, he was <hi>like to ſinful fleſh;</hi> yet he was only <hi>Like,</hi> and not indeed ſuch: but perfectly Innocent, and perfectly Righteous: As is evident by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by Reaſon too.</p>

               <hi>in Word; the ſame is a perfect Man;</hi> he never offended this way; for there was <hi>no guile found in his Mouth;</hi> Which the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">1 Pet. ii. 22.</note> in particular, to vindicate his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, from the malicious Calumnies of the <hi>Jews;</hi> who accuſed and condemned him, as a falſe Prophet, and a Blaſphemer.</p>
            <p>And no wonder, that no ſin ever procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of his Mouth; ſince none ever enter'd into his Heart. For when <hi>the Prince</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. xiv. 30.</note> 
               <hi>of this World came to him, he found nothing in him.</hi> Not ſo much as an evil Thought, to take part with any of his Temptations. This his unſpotted Purity, was foretold by the Prophets long before; and repreſented by thoſe Sacrifices that were Types of him.</p>
            <p>And great Reaſon there was in the ſecond place; That he ſhould be abſolutely free from ſin. For had he not been a Lamb without Blemiſh, he had not been fit for a Sacrifice. Had he had ſin Himſelf, he had not been in a capacity of making ſatisfaction for the ſins of others: And therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that it became us;</hi> 'twas not only <hi>meet,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary;</hi> that <hi>we ſhould have</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. vii. 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>an High Prieſt, who needed not to offer Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100329:9"/> 
               <hi>firſt for his own ſins;</hi> for had he needed that, he could not have offered a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sacrifice for Ours. That therefore he might be qualified, to make ſuch a Sacrifice for us, that might be <hi>a ſweet ſmelling ſavour;</hi> 'twas needful, that he Himſelf ſhould be Holy, and without Blemiſh.</p>
            <p>And yet there was great Reaſon, why (though perfectly pure from ſin) he ſhould be ſent into the World, in the <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of a Sinner. And that</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he might by his own Example, more powerfully teach us, to deny our Credit, when it ſtands in Competition with our Duty; to be content to be reputed vile perſons, rather than make our ſelves really ſuch. This is a piece of ſelf-denyal, in which Good men do commonly meet with the greateſt Difficulty: For the more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous any Perſons are, at ſo much the higher rate do they value their good Name; and therefore are never in greater danger of being drawn to the Commiſſion of ſin, than when they ſhall be looked upon as Sinners, for not committing it. That therefore we might be the better fortified againſt this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100329:10"/> dangerous Temptation, God was pleaſed to ſend his own Son into the World, to be treated as a ſinner; that looking to Him, the Captain of our Salvation, we may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him with an Undaunted Courage and Reſolution, through <hi>Honour and Diſhonour;</hi> through <hi>Evil Report, and good Report.</hi> That we may be willing to Sacrifice, not only our Lives; but (which is more) our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation too, rather than do any thing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming our Holy Profeſſion. This is that to which St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, and that upon this very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: <hi>becauſe Chriſt alſo hath ſuffered for us,</hi>

               <hi>leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> And this is no more, than what the Primitive Chriſtians, had daily Trials of; and which animated by ſo great an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they moſt cheerfully endur'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he might the more Effectually recommend to our Affection and Practiſe, all other the moſt excellent Chriſtian Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſuch as Charity, Humility, Meekneſs, Obedience to our Governours, intire ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Divine Will, in ſuffering, as well as doing: All which were moſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

How can he be Proud, who ſets before his Eyes, the Unparallel Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Lord of Glory? How can he fret and fume at every little neglect; who conſiders his immoveable Patience, under the moſt Contumelious and Deſpightful uſage?

            <p>In humble Obedience to this Command which his Father gave him, and in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100329:11"/> to theſe Predictions; he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offered himſelf to a violent and cruel death: <hi>For knowing all things that ſhould come</hi>

               <hi>upon him,</hi> he went to the place, whither a band of Souldiers and Officers, were ſent to apprehend him; and after he had given them to underſtand how eaſily he could baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle all their attempts, in caſe he had a mind to reſiſt them (by ſtriking them down to the ground with a word of his mouth) he gave himſelf up into their hands; who forthwith led him away bound to thoſe, whoſe Malice he knew was ſo implacable, that it would be ſatisfyed with nothing leſs than his Blood; and by their inſtigation he was condemn'd to Death (after the Judge had again and again acquitted him) and by wicked hands was crucified and ſlain. And that he might exactly anſwer thoſe Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Law, by which his was moſt eminently prefigur'd; he not only pour'd out his Soul unto Death, but he alſo ſuffer'd without the gate of the City: like as <hi>the</hi>

            <p>And ſince God was ſo ſevere in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions upon his only Son, can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he will ſpare us, if in contempt and defiance of his Juſtice, we ſhall ſtill harden our ſelves in Rebellion againſt him?

               <hi>was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience receiv'd a juſt recompence of reward; how ſhall we eſcape, if we deſpiſe ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> There is no poſſibility of their eſcape from the Damnation of Hell in the other World, who refuſe to be delivered from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100329:15"/> their ſins in this World. <hi>And who can dwell with devouring Fire? Who can dwell with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings?</hi> 'Tis a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a Revenging God, whoſe Power is equal to his Juſtice, and who lives for ever to take Vengeance; 'Twas ever a fearful thing, but 'twill be now more, eſpecially ſo to thoſe who cleave to their ſins, after God hath ſo fully diſcovered how intolerably odious they are to him. This will be their Condemnation, (their Condemnation with a Witneſs) that they ſtill perſiſt in their ſins, notwithſtanding God hath ſo plainly made known, how infinitely dear they ſhall pay for them.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Conſideration of Chriſt's Death, as a Sacrifice for ſin, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to drive and affright us from it, as 'tis the moſt evident Demonſtration of God's unappeaſable Wrath againſt ſin; than 'tis to attract and allure us to Holineſs. As 'tis</p>
            <p n="2">2. An unparallel Expreſſion of his Love and kindneſs to ſinners; of his exceeding readineſs to pardon them upon their ſincere Repentance; and to make them everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly happy.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:100329:15"/>
            <p> It would have argu'd great Clemency in the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth, had he but given us leave to have petition'd him for Mercy. But though he reſolv'd to prevent us by his Grace, and while we were yet ſinners and obnoxious to his Vengeance, to make offers of Reconciliation to us; had it not been enough to have ſent them, by one of the meaneſt of thoſe miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that continually attend upon him? But if he would love us ſo much, who ſo much deſerv'd his Hatred, as to ſend his only Son out of his own boſom to us; Who could have imagin'd, but he would have ſent him aray'd with Light, ſhining with ſuch amazing Glory and Majeſty, as might have given the World to underſtand the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent Dignity of his Perſon: But to ſend him in <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and which is yet more vile <hi>in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> that in that odious diſguiſe he might deliver him up to the moſt accurſed Death, to purchaſe a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for us Miſcreants with his own moſt precious Blood. <hi>What manner of Love</hi> was this? Well might St. <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>Herein is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. ix. 1</note> 
               <hi>Love.</hi> You will ſay perhaps, and in what not?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100329:16"/> Since the love of God is plainly legible in all his works. True, but <hi>herein is love</hi> ſo tranſcendent, that all the love ſhew'd to Mankind in the works of Creation, and common Providence deſerves not to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when compared with it. Even our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, as if unable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, ſpeaks of it with admiration. <hi>So</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John iii. 16.</note> 
               <hi>God loved the World!</hi> So inexpreſſibly, ſo inconceivably.</p>
            <p>And is it poſſible, after ſuch a ſtupendous Teſtimony of God's love to ſinners; that the greateſt ſinner in the VVorld ſhould ſo much as queſtion his readineſs to pardon him, upon his ſincere Repentance? Has God given his only Son to die for us, to the end that he may be <hi>juſt,</hi> and yet <hi>the juſtifyer of him that believeth in Jeſus?</hi> And now <note place="margin">Rom. iii. 26.</note> that all the demands of his Juſtice are fully ſatisfyed, ſhall he not much more give us a Pardon? What can hinder? When even Juſtice it ſelf is now become an Advocate for ſinners, and pleads for Mercy. And therefore St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>if we confeſs our ſins,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John i. 9.</note> not that he is <hi>merciful,</hi> but <hi>he is juſt to forgive us our ſins. Let</hi> therefore <hi>the Wicked forſake</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. lv. 7.</note>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100329:16"/> 
               <hi>his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon. Tho' his ſins be as ſcarlet, they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. i. 18.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be as white as ſnow; tho' they be red like crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can there be a more potent Motive to Repentance? Unleſs it be that God will not barely pardon, but for the redundant Merit of this all-ſufficient Sacrifice, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo advance us to a more glorious and happy ſtate, than that which by ſin we loſt. What Rebel would not relent and return to Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; were he unqueſtionably aſſur'd that his Prince would be ſo far from puniſhing him, that he would on the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote him to the higheſt Honours? Such an aſſurance has God given to all truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners; that he will not only <hi>be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and remember their ſins and iniquities no more;</hi> but will take them into his boſom, treat them as his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; Yea, make them Co-heirs together with his Son, of his own everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Glory.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100329:17"/>
            <p> And can the moſt reſolute ſinner in the World be ſo obſtinate, as not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and yield himſelf a Captive to ſuch Love? And if we are once brought under the Power of Divine Love; this alone will raiſe and unite all the Forces of our Souls againſt our ſins, and make us cry out with as much vehemency againſt them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did againſt our Saviour, <hi>Crucifie</hi> them, <hi>Crucifie</hi> them; Let not one of them eſcape alive, and let thoſe above all the reſt be put to a reproachful Death, that we have formerly been moſt enchanted and led Captive by.</p>
            <p>If beſides theſe mighty Motives, (which one would think were ſufficient, to give ſtrength to the weakeſt; and to raiſe them to the Life of God, who are quite dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes) any thing further can be needful to this purpoſe. Conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That God (as the Purchaſe of this meritorious Sacrifice) hath alſo ſent his Holy Spirit to aſſiſt our Endeavours; to raiſe and renew our Faculties, and to ſtrengthen us with that might in the inner man, by which we may be enabled to get
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100329:17"/> the Victory over our ſtrongeſt and moſt imperious inordinate Luſts: For certainly the moſt domineering and prevailing ſin, hath not gotten ſuch abſolute Dominion over us, but by the aſſiſtance of this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Spirit, we may be ſet free from the Bondage of it.</p>
            <p>We can ſcarce imagine any perſons more under the Power of vile Affections, than thoſe ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> vi. 9, 10. And yet how deeply ſoever they were ſunk into the Mire, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 11. that they were <hi>waſhed,</hi> that they were <hi>ſanctifyed,</hi> that they were <hi>juſtifyed, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> In the early ages of the Goſpel, ſo common, and ſo apparent were the Effects of the Divine Graces, in reforming the moſt outrageouſly vicious perſons, that they were matter of great Boaſting and Triumph to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And God be thanked, our own Age is not deſtitute of ſome famous Inſtances of this Nature: And that we meet not with many more; 'tis not to be imputed to Gods backwardneſs to give; but to our unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100329:18"/> to receive his Holy Spirit; and to that Rude and Churliſh entertainment we give him, when he makes his viſits to us. Did we but readily comply with his Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yield our ſelves up to be led by them; we ſhould ſoon find it not only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but eaſie; Yea, the moſt pleaſant and delightful thing in the World, <hi>to deny all Ungodlineſs, and Worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World: Looking for the bleſſed Hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
